class DifferentialGeometry: 
    """
        Introduction
        ------------
        A computational toolkit for differential geometry operations in curved spacetime.

        This class computes geometric quantities from metric tensors using automatic differentiation.
        Common use cases:
        - Geometric analysis of curved manifolds
        - General relativity applications
        - Testing neural representations of spacetime metrics
        - Operations on tensors in curved spaces

        The `DifferentialGeometry` class serves as the primary interface, providing
        automatic differentiation-based computation of curvature tensors, connections,
        and geometric invariants from a metric tensor specification. 

        The primary goal is to provide ways to test the training of EinFields, our newly developed neural representation of the metric
        tensor, with all the objects general relativity has to offer. Although the metric tensor in general relativity is the main
        object of interest, the functionalities of the class are not limited to only four dimensional spacetime, but can easily be used 
        in other dimensions as well. Having said this, the class is designed to work equally well in a more general setting whether it is
        a Riemannian or a pseudo-Riemannian manifold.

        General relativity
        ------------------
        Einstein questioned whether the gravitational acceleration is somehow an "illusion". In a vacuum, where the gravitational field is 
        constant, bodies fall at the same rate and they would not be able to tell whether there is a force or not. This very simplified view 
        actually describes the essence of general relativity in "small" regions of spacetime, or in other words, in a local inertial frame. 
        In reality, if two bodies are sufficiently far apart and released at some distance above the surface of the Earth, they will start 
        to approach each other. 
        
        This leads to the idea that if freely falling bodies are following geodesics, then this approach (or divergence)
        is due to non-local effects, namely non-constant gravitational field which translates into the geometric concept of geodesic deviation, 
        described by the Riemann curvature tensor. Then, general relativity becomes a description of the geometry of spacetime, more exactly,
        a pseudo-Riemannian manifold with a metric tensor field encoding the effects of gravity. 
        
        All Einstein's ideas are converted into
        the mathematical description of differential geometry. Locally, the metric tensor can be approximated by the Minkowski metric, which 
        reduces the problem to flat spacetimes, and so bodies can't "feel" gravity from their local perspective. However, the variation of the
        gravitational field (or tidal forces) translated as the global curvature of the spacetime manifold introduces non-local effects. Moreover,
        the theory is independent of the coordinate system used to describe the spacetime in the sense that physical laws aren't modified.

        Class overview
        --------------
        As it happens for a Riemannian or pseudo-Riemannian manifold, all the geometric quantities can be derived from the metric tensor. Thus,
        the `DifferentialGeometry` class follows a linear workflow, where everything starts from the metric tensor and proceeds forward. 
        
        The key 
        computational pipeline:

        `metric` → `christoffel_symbols` → `riemann_tensor` → `ricci_tensor` → `ricci_scalar`.

        To respect JAX's functional programming paradigm, the `metric` is a Python function (def, class method, static method or lambda),
        which takes only one input, a `jax.Array` representing the coordinates of a point on the manifold, and returns a `jax.Array` representing the 
        metric tensor at that point, a 4x4 matrix in the case of four-dimensional spacetime. The `metric` function is not allowed to be wrapped
        in `jax.vmap` before passing it to the class.

        All tensor operations are implemented with `jnp.einsum` for maximum performance from the various optimizations einsum provides. A list of
        available and most important differential geometry quantities is provided below:
        - `christoffel_symbols`
        - `riemann_tensor`
        - `ricci_tensor`
        - `ricci_scalar`
        - `weyl_curvature_tensor`
        - `einstein_tensor`
        - `kretschmann_invariant`
        - `tetrad`

        Most of the methods (apart from the static ones) have only the coordinates `jax.Array` as input, making it easy to vectorize and compute
        the quantities over a batch of coordinates. For more details on the differential geometry quantities, please refer to our paper in the
        appendix section [...].

        Operations on tensors
        ---------------------
        Two essential geometric operations are the `lie_derivative` and the `levi_civita_connection` (covariant derivative).
        Because the Lie derivative is independent of connection and thus of the metric tensor it is a static method, while the covariant derivative
        is a method of the class, as it requires the Christoffel symbols from the metric. 

        These can be called as follows:

        ```
            from .../tensor_calculus import DifferentialGeometry as diffgeo
        
            coords = jnp.array([0.0, 4.0, jnp.pi/2, 0.0])  # Example coordinates
            vector_field = lambda coords: coords

            schwarzschild_geo = diffgeo(schwarzschild_metric)

            lie_derivative = diffgeo.lie_derivative(coord=coords, 
            vector_field=vector_field, 
            tensor=schwarzschild_metric, 
            rank=[0, 0])

            covariant_derivative = schwarzschild_geo.levi_civita_connection(coords=coords, 
            tensor=schwarzschild_metric, rank=[0, 0])

        ```
        

        Parameters
        ----------
        metric : Callable[[jax.Array], jax.Array]
            A function that takes a `jax.Array` of coordinates and returns the metric tensor at that point.
            The metric tensor must be a square matrix of shape (dim, dim), where dim is the dimension of the manifold.
            For example, if the jax.Array has shape (dim,), then the metric function should return a jax.Array of shape (dim, dim).

        Examples
        --------
        >>> # Schwarzschild black hole
        >>> from gr_package.gr_problems.schwarzschild import schwarzschild_metric_spherical
        >>> schwarzschild_fn = lambda coords: schwarzschild_metric_spherical(coords, M=1.0)
        >>> schwarzschild_geo = DifferentialGeometry(metric_fn)
        >>> coords = jnp.array([0.0, 4.0, jnp.pi/2, 0.0])  # Outside horizon
        >>>  # Compute various geometric quantities
        >>> christoffel = schwarzschild_geo.christoffel_symbols(coords) # shape (4, 4, 4)
        >>> riemann_tensor = schwarzschild_geo.riemann_tensor(coords) # shape (4, 4, 4, 4)
        >>> ricci_tensor = schwarzschild_geo.ricci_tensor(coords) # shape (4, 4)
        >>> ricci_scalar = schwarzschild_geo.ricci_scalar(coords) # shape ()
        >>> weyl_tensor = schwarzschild_geo.weyl_curvature_tensor(coords) # shape (4, 4, 4, 4)
        >>> kretschmann_scalar = schwarzschild_geo.kretschmann_invariant(coords) # shape ()


        Future work
        -----------
        Although most operations on tensors don't require a complicated handling of the rank,
        there can be scenarios where it might be useful to compose some of this operations, 
        such as the composition of Levi-Civita connection on a tensor field multiple times 
        increases the covariant rank. For more flexibility and ease of use with this differential
        geometry perspective, we plan to implement a tensor field class which should, among other things,
        keep track of the rank. Moreover, the compatibility with JAX's functional programming paradigm
        will require the tensor field object have a `__call__` method, which will allow it to be used
        as a function that takes coordinates and returns the array representation at those coordinates.

        For a contraction with an upper index there is a - sign and a + sign for a lower index. In case a connection is used,
