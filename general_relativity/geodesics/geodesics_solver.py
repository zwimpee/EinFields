        Solves the geodesic equation for a given metric, that has to be initialized with its corresponding differential geometry object.

        For further details about the solver, consult the official diffrax documentation: https://docs.kidger.site/diffrax/.

        Parameters
        ----------

        metric : DifferentialGeometry
            The differential geometry object initialized with the metric.
        

        init_condition: jax.Array 
            The initial condition for the geodesic equation. It can be a batch of initial conditions.

        t0: float
            The initial time.

        t1: float 
            The final time.
        
        dt: float
            The initial time step at t0.

        saveat: diffrax.SaveAt
            The timesteps where to save the solution.

        solver: diffrax.AbstractSolver 
            The ODE solver to use.

        stepsize_controller: diffrax.AbstractStepSizeController 
            Adaptive stepsize controller.

        throw: bool 
            Whether to throw an error if the solver fails (such as reaching max_steps).
        
        max_steps: int 
            The maximum number of steps allowed to reached the tollerance region provided by the stepsize controller.
            When saveAt(steps=True), the solution will be an array of shape (max_steps, ...) and if the solver doesn't need all the steps, it will be padded with NaNs.
        
        coord_transform: Callable[[jax.Array], jax.Array]
            A function that transforms the coordinates acoording to the training domain of the neural field. 
        
        progress_meter: diffrax.AbstractProgressMeter
            The progress meter to use.
        
        Returns
        -------

        geodesic_y0: Callable[[jax.Array], diffrax.Solution]
            The function that takes an initial condition and returns the solution of the geodesic equation.
            The solution is a diffrax.Solution object, which contains the time steps and the corresponding
            geodesic coordinates and velocities. This function is vectorized for handling batches 
            and then JIT compiled for performance.
